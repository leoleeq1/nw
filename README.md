# nw

nw is a simple cross platform window generator for c++.
It can create a native window and handle events.
It can draw a bitmap on the window in case you need.

That's it.

## Why?

To reduce repetitive workloads when you start a new project for a simple demo.
All you need is just create a window and handle some events. And everything else is on your own.
