# nw

nw is a lightweight cross platform gui framework for c++.
It can create a native window and handle events.

That's it.

## Why?

To reduce repetitive workloads when you start a new project for a simple graphics demo, a game or something.
All you need is just create a window and handle some events. And everything else is on your own.
